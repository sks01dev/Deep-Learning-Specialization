# üõ†Ô∏è L-Layer Deep Neural Network: Step-by-Step Implementation

## ‚úçÔ∏è Description

This project implements the foundational, vectorized "building blocks" required to construct a deep neural network (DNN) with an arbitrary number of layers ($L$). Unlike previous assignments, which focused on a 2-layer network, this notebook generalizes all necessary functions‚Äîfrom initialization to parameter updates‚Äîto support deep architectures. This modular approach is essential for scaling to complex problems like image classification.

The architecture implemented is: **[LINEAR -> ReLU] $\times$ (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID**.

### Key Implementations:

* **Initialization:** Creating parameters for both 2-layer and $L$-layer networks using randomized weights and zero biases.
* **Forward Propagation Module:** Implementing the `LINEAR`, `LINEAR -> ACTIVATION` (ReLU/Sigmoid), and the full `L_model_forward` functions.
* **Backward Propagation Module:** Implementing the `LINEAR_backward`, `LINEAR -> ACTIVATION_backward`, and the comprehensive `L_model_backward` functions.
* **Optimization:** Implementing the `update_parameters` function using Gradient Descent.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run this notebook, you need a Python environment with the standard scientific computing libraries.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sks01dev/Deep-Learning-Specialization
    cd Deep-Learning-Specialization
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Note: This assumes `dnn_utils.py` and `testCases.py` are locally available, as they are part of the original specialization material.)
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib h5py
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

This notebook primarily focuses on **function implementation and testing** using provided test cases.

1.  **Start Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Open and run the notebook** (`Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb`).
3.  Execute each cell to verify the correctness of all $L$-layer functions against the expected output, confirming that the mathematics of deep learning have been correctly vectorized in Python.

## üß† Key Learnings

1.  **Modular DNN Design:** Mastered the principle of building a complex DNN by chaining simple, independent modules (`Linear`, `ReLU`, `Sigmoid`). This modularity allows for easy customization of network depth ($L$).
2.  **L-Layer Generalization:** Successfully transitioned from a fixed 2-layer model to an $L$-layer model using strategic `for` loops and dictionary indexing (e.g., `'W' + str(l)`), demonstrating scalability.
3.  **ReLU Implementation:** Gained experience using the **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** activation and its gradient, understanding its role in introducing non-linearity and solving the vanishing gradient problem.
4.  **Deep Backpropagation:** Deepened the understanding of the **chain rule** by implementing the backward pass across $L$ layers, ensuring correct caching and gradient flow from $dAL$ back to $dA^{[0]}$.

## üöÄ Future Work

* **Integration (Next Assignment):** Combine these functions into a complete `L_layer_model()` class to classify real-world datasets (e.g., Cat vs. Non-Cat images).
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Apply these functions to test the impact of varying the number of layers ($L$) and hidden units on performance.
* **Advanced Initialization:** Experiment with more robust initialization techniques (like He initialization) rather than the fixed `* 0.01` scaling used here.
