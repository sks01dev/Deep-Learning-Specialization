This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments for the **Deep Learning Specialization** offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. The five-course program is taught by the renowned Andrew Ng and provides a comprehensive foundation in deep learning theory and practice.

### 2. About the specialization

This specialization is designed to help you master the foundations of deep learning, build and train neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects.

Through the coursework, I gained practical, hands-on experience in:
- Building and training neural networks using NumPy and TensorFlow.
- Implementing best practices for deep learning development, including regularization, optimization, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Tackling real-world case studies in computer vision, natural language processing, and more.

### 3. Repository structure and content

The repository is organized by course, with each course directory containing the Jupyter Notebooks for the programming assignments.
